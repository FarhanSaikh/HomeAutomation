DESIGN AND IDEAS OF THE PRODUCTS:-


App Functionalities:-
⦁	Provide temperature and humidity values of the room.
⦁	Switches to control devices.
⦁	Calculation of ON-time of the devices for the whole day.
⦁	Auto/Manual mode for home devices.
⦁	Shows notification asking whether to ON or OFF the switch of particular device if certain condition is satisfied. For eg., if temperature is greater than 25 degree Celsius, it will ask user whether he/she wants to turn the AC/fan switch ON or not, and if the device is ON for a long time then it will ask user whether it should switch it OFF and acts accordingly hence more focus will be given on energy saving. 



Hardwares Required:-
⦁	NODE MCU (with ESP8266)
⦁	DHT SENSOR (DHT11)
⦁	RELAY (2 channel)
⦁	DEVICES (BULB/FAN/AC/LED) 



Firebase Real-time Database:
Instead of typical HTTP requests, the Firebase Real-time Database uses data synchronization—every time data changes, any connected device receives that update within milliseconds. Provide collaborative and immersive experiences without thinking about networking code. Data is synced across all clients in real-time and remains available when your app goes offline.
